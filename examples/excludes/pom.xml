                        <!--
                        This examples presents how to selectively exclude some of the transitive dependencies of an artifact.
                        In order to enable this functionality the <excludes> section has to be included
                        in the configuration of the artifact.
                        If the fetch of the transitive dependencies is disabled through the <transitive>false</transitive> switch
                        the <excludes> section will be ignored.

                        The <excludes> resolver reuses the org.sonatype.aether.util.filter.PatternExclusionsDependencyFilter
                        that works in the following way:
                            PatternExclusionsDependencyFilter is a simple filter to exclude artifacts specified by patterns.
                            The artifact pattern syntax has the following format: [groupId]:[artifactId]:[extension]:[version].
                            Each segment of the pattern is optional and supports 'full' and 'partial' wildcards (*).
                            An empty pattern segment is treated as an implicit wildcard.
                            Version can be a range in case a {@link VersionScheme} is specified.

                        Examples of <exclude> values:
                          * <exclude>org.apache.*</exclude> matches artifacts whose group-id begins with 'org.apache.'
                          * <exclude>:::*-SNAPSHOT</exclude> matches all snapshot artifacts
                          * <exclude>:objenesis::</exclude> matches artifacts whose artifactId is objenesis
                          * <exclude>*</exclude> matches all artifacts
                          * <exclude>:::</exclude> (or <exclude>*:*:*:*</exclude>) matches all artifacts
                          * <exclude></exclude> matches all artifacts

                        Expected behavior:
                          - selected transitive dependencies will be fetched

                        Example usage:
                            <artifact>
                                <id>org.mockito:mockito-core:1.9.0</id>
                                <source>false</source>
                                <transitive>true</transitive>
                                <excludes>
                                    <exclude>org.objenesis:objenesis:jar:1.0</exclude>
                                </excludes>
                            </artifact>
